## ðŸ’Ž Introduction

I was in need of quick static site generator that uses less JS, so that I can deploy leaner. So I created this. It is based from Hugo v0.132.2 + Bulma CSS v1.0. 

Template for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), a static page generator.  
Layout with the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS Framework based on Flexbox.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

The theme file is in the `themes/neobrute` dir, so in order to use it, you need first to install Hugo in your development environment and then `git submodule` it.
I'll write an eloborate instruction later. In the meantime, you may have a look at [Hugo Deployment](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/)

## Hugo v0.132.2 + Bulma v0.91

This is my portfolio static site, showcasing the main page, my resume, and selected case studies of my previous work. Initially, I was using the latest version of Bulma (v1.0); however, since Hugo Dart SASS does not support some newer SASS features like @forward and @use, I am unable to render it correctly. I may redo it later with the latest version of Bulma to ensure compatibility with Dart SASS.
